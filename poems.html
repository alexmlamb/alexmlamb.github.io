<b>Deep Learning Poems:</b>
<br/><br/>
Like a rotten log <br/>
half resulting in NaNs - <br/>
my training, which <br/>
has not finished, comes <br/>
to this sad <blink>end</blink>. <br/>
<br/><br/>
When gradients flow<br/>
Not one hidden unit will remain <br/>
The way that it was <br/>
<br/><br/>
Deep Learning Papers <br/>
Are they but mere delusions? <br/>
SOTA is SOTA <br/>
<br/><br/>
Had I not known<br/>
That I was already scooped<br/>
I would have mourned<br/>
The Loss of my GPU<br/>
<br/><br/>
We have brought the students to a windowless lab*<br/>
Away from the world, and yet the world torments them.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Inside a terminal, a student’s empty shell.<br/>
Sadly I muse upon the shell of a graduate student<br/>
<br/><br/>

Seeing NaNs<br/>
Clears up reality<br/>
And dream alike<br/>

<br/><br/>
I cannot change the algorithm so close to the deadline<br/>
I know that others have, but I cannot.  <br/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Holding back my graduation<br/>
With its increasing frequency<br/>
The summer internship<br/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Notice how, not even for a single update <br/>
Does the gradient stay the same.  <br/>
Witness the sign of the hessian.  <br/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

If I were the gradient<br/>
The forget gate would not be able to<br/>
Keep me away from you<br/>

<br/><br/>
Students outside the professor's door<br/>
Gradients in a batch<br/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
There is no output<br/>
There is no input<br/>
Indeed, every layer<br/>
is dream after dream<br/>
<br/><br/>

*Only applies to the old MILA office, the new MILA office has windows!
