-The case against novelty: making research better by making it more incremental

-Many students are told that they need to make their research more and articles have decried research being too incremental (cite).

-However I believe that this preference for novel research is partially supported by an overloaded definition for novelty, which I'll attempt to separate out.  Moreover, I think that there is a clear case to be made that there are significant advantages to doing more incremental research.  Finally I'll go through some case studies and try to make the case that many of the most important ideas in science have actually been the result of incremental research.  

-The problem of term-overloading.  Many people like to describe ideas as "novel" or "incremental", but in doing so they lump the idea and the results from the idea together.  Instead we should treat these as separate entities.  What we want is ideas which are "parameter space incremental" but which yield substantially different results.  For brevity, let's call the novelty of the idea itself "p-novel and p-incremental", where p is short for parameter-space.  Let's refer to the novelty of the results as "f-novelty", where f is short for "function space", referring to the output of the idea.  

A p-incremental is an idea that can be described very quickly and has very changes from the existing status quo.  The term "elegance" partially captures the idea of p-incrementality, but not completely as p-incrementality also refers to how similar an idea is to previous ideas.

-From this view, it is fairly obvious that f-novelty is desirable.  We want to have ideas that have a large positive impact.  On the other hand, is it better for ideas to be p-novel or p-incremental?  I think that when the question has been properly posed, it is actually obvious that it is better to have ideas which are p-incremental.  Before making the explicit case for why it's better to be p-incremental, I'll lay out a few examples of ideas that I consider to be good examples of f-novel and p-incremental research.

Case 1: Special Relativity (I'm not a physicist, but I'll have a physicist review this section for correctness).  The special relativity program uses no new mechanics, and its algorithmic description is the same as the lorentzian mechanics.  The idea itself can be communicated succinctly, and it's mostly a change in interpretation.  Nonetheless it has substantial implications (f-novelty).

Case 2: PCR.

Case 3: Deep Learning.  This is the example with which I have the most familiarity.  


My hope is that, rather than just complaining about how people use terms, that I can spur people to shift their language to start referring to "p-novelty" and "f-novelty", with the goal that people will be able to use these terms and avoid using "novel" as a term of praise and "incremental" as a pejorative.
