<br><b>Short Essays:</b><br>

I'll post some short essays of mine here when I get around to writing them.  

<br/><b>Background: </b> <br/>

I did my undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked with Mark Dredze.  After that I worked at the demand forecasting group at Amazon as a research scientist.  Then I started my PhD at the Universite de Montreal (MILA).  I have done internships at Preferred Networks (working with Takeru Miyato) and Google Brain (working with David Ha).  <br/>

<b>Demand Forecasting</b> <br/>

When I worked at Amazon (2013-2015), I developed demand forecasting systems using deep learning.  <br/>

<br/>

<b>Twitter Flu Analysis</b> <br/>

We built a system to analyze tweets about the flu to discriminate between people having the flu and people simply discussing the flu.  Using the system the results are significantly closer to CDC's estimated infection rates.  This was oral at NAACL 2013 and received extensive press coverage.  <br/>
