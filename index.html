<b>Deep Learning Poems:</b>
<br/><br/>
Like a rotten log <br/>
half resulting in NaNs - <br/>
my training, which <br/>
has not finished, comes <br/>
to this sad end. <br/>
<br/><br/>
When gradients flow <br/>
Not one hidden unit will remain <br/>
The way that it was <br/>
<br/><br/>
Deep Learning Papers <br/>
Are they but mere delusions? <br/>
SOTA is SOTA <br/>
<br/><br/>
Had I not known<br/>
That I was already scooped<br/>
I would have mourned<br/>
The Loss of my GPU<br/>
<br/><br/>
Beneath a tree, a locustâ€™s empty shell.<br/>
Sadly I muse upon the shell of a graduate student<br/>
