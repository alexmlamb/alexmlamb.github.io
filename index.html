<b>Research Interests:</b> <br/>

-How the brain works.  <br/>

-Limitations in neural networks, especially those that coincide with things that humans do well.  <br/>

-History and language.  <br/>

<b>Background: </b> <br/>

Previously employed by Preferred Networks (PFN) and Amazon.  <br/>

<!--  <b>Research Quiz</b><br/>
Love all of my papers but not sure which one to read first?  You're not alone.  Take this quiz which will tell you what to read (still haven't made this yet).  <br/>

<b>ML Conference Reviewer Certification Test</b><br/>

ML conferences are recognizing deficincies in reviewer quality.  To address this they have asked me to create a certification test to ensure that all reviewers will be qualified (still need to make this).  <br/>

<b>Demand Forecasting</b> <br/>

When I worked at Amazon (2013-2015), I developed demand forecasting systems using deep learning.  <br/>

<b>Twitter Flu Analysis</b> <br/>

We built a system to analyze tweets about the flu to discriminate between people having the flu and people simply discussing the flu.  Using the system the results are significantly closer to CDC's estimated infection rates.  This was oral at NAACL 2013 and received extensive press coverage.  <br/>
