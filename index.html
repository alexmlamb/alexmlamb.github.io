<b>Research Interests:</b> <br/>

-How the brain works.  <br/>

-Limitations in neural networks, especially those that coincide with things that humans do well.  <br/>

-History and language.  <br/>

<b>Background: </b> <br/>

Previously employed by Preferred Networks (PFN) and Amazon.  <br/>

<!--  <b>Research Quiz</b><br/>
Love all of my papers but not sure which one to read first?  You're not alone.  Take this quiz which will tell you what to read (still haven't made this yet).  <br/>

<b>ML Conference Reviewer Certification Test</b><br/>

ML conferences are recognizing deficincies in reviewer quality.  To address this they have asked me to create a certification test to ensure that all reviewers will be qualified (still need to make this).  <br/>

<b>Applied Research Projects</b><br/>

<p>Pre-Modern Japanese: Japan reformed their writing system in 1900, making all of their writing from 800-1900 unreadable to all but a handful of specially trained scholars.  Thus many interesting and practically important documents such as the following guide on how to identify fish people are unreadable by the average Japanese person!

<p>
To help address this, we've built an ML system which can recognize the Japanese characters!  Check out some results (blue is ground truth, green is predicted, errors are marked with a red X):

<b>Demand Forecasting</b> <br/>

When I worked at Amazon (2013-2015), I developed demand forecasting systems using deep learning.  

<b>Twitter Flu Analysis</b> <br/>

We built a system to analyze tweets about the flu to discriminate between people having the flu and people simply discussing the flu.  Using the system the results are significantly closer to CDC's estimated infection rates.  This was oral at NAACL 2013 and received extensive press coverage.
