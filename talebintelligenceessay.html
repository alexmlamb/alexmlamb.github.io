Nasim Taleb has a few arguments against intelligence, which I'll briefly discuss here.  <br/>

I think they're mostly wrong, but I'll point out a few that I think are correct.  <br/>

1.  Taleb's main technical argument is that a correlation can exist between two variables which take the same value
over some subset of the domain but are otherwise uncorrelated.  In the case of intelligence, he hints that this is the
result of a threshold effect in which abilities are correlated in the mentally impaired but otherwise uncorrelated.  
However he does not present any concrete evidence for this view.  To my knowledge, there is no threshold where mental
abilities stop being correlated, and indeed experiments on children who could perform well on the SAT at a young age
support this.  He shows a scatter plot between IQ and SAT scores, where the IQ test seems to have a ceiling, and this 
ceiling obviously explains the shape of the curve (there's probably no real threshold suggested by the data).  <br/>

2.  His argument about intelligence, income, and new worth is more interesting.  He cites (Zagorsky 2007) which gives
some statistics on this from the early 2000s.  I would definitely recommend reading this paper, but I would be interested
in knowing the details behind some of the data points.  For example, the income-IQ scatter plot shows a single person 
with an IQ in the low 70s (close to the legal threshold for mental retardation) with an income of 180k (in the early 2000s).  
I would be curious to learn more about this situation.  Did the person simply do poorly on the test?  Or did the person find
some kind of employment not requiring a substantial amount of academic performance?  Did they use some faulty accounting 
or make a mistake in reporting their income (from reading the paper, it sounds like income is self-reported)?  Seeing points 
like this make me skeptical of a study.  

Besides that, the data seems reasonable.  Intelligence and net worth show a small correlation whereas income and intelligence
show a somewhat stronger correlation.  I'm not sure why Taleb believes that income and intelligence should be very highly
correlated.  If someone were to take a position as a professor (in a typical field), the intellectual demands are quite high, 
but the salary is only moderate.  Likewise, there are some jobs that pay reasonably well, and while involving certain types of
skills, are not highly intellectual in nature (jobs in sales and real estate might be the primary examples).  

Beyond that, another reason to expect income and intelligence to not be highly correlated is that achieving a high income 
requires other skills and also other decisions.  If a person is born into a small town and wishes to remain in that area, 
then their ability to achieve a higher income using their abilities will be limited.  To give a concrete example of this, a 
software engineer willing to move to a city with a strong software industry (such as San Francisco) will pretty much always
make more than a software engineer who stays somewhere remote (even after cost of living adjustment), regardless of their
abilities.  This is even stronger globally, as the majority of the world's population speaks a language which is not used
by the highest paying international corporations.  

Taleb makes another mistake here, in that when he presents these graphs with the intent of showing a threshold, he *cuts off
on the y-axis* whereas he should be cutting off on the *x-axis*.  I think this is a subtle mistake, so he may have made it 
by accident.  His goal is to show that there is no correlation between income and intelligence where intelligence exceeds 
some threshold.  He could accomplish this by cutting off the lower intelligence part of the graph along the x-axis, because
this would restrict to his population of interest.  However cutting off the y-axis (only showing high incomes) is misleading
because density is not uniformly distributed over the x-axis, so it could give the appearance that there is no correlation 
above the threshold when there really is.  

Even putting that aside, I counted the dots with an income above 180k in his scatter plot.  I counted 9 from 120-130, 6 from
110-120, 4 from 100-110, 5 from 90-100, 3 from 80-90, and 1 from 70-80.  Even if these ranges had the same number of people
(they don't), there's still a pretty large gap.  

3.  I basically agree with Taleb about making crude judgements about nationalities or places based on their history and I
don't have much to criticize there with one exception.  Taleb says that the Germans had no accomplishments prior to the last
few hundred years, but I would point out that the Germans defeated a Roman invasion, so I wouldn't say that they had *no* 
ancient accomplishments.
